# tcpdump for DRb
#
# == Usage
#
# The +drbdump+ command-line utility works similarly to tcpdump.  Here's the
# easiest way to get started:
#
#   sudo drbdump
#
# This captures DRb messages on your loopback and public interface.  You can
# disable name resolution with <code>-n</code>.  You can also drop root
# privileges with the -Z option if you don't want drbdump to run as root after
# it creates the capture device.
#
# == Output
#
# +drbdump+ reassembles TCP streams to create a complete message-send or
# message result and displays it to you when complete.  Here is an object in a
# Rinda::TupleSpace being renewed (checked if it is still alive), but broken
# into two lines:
#
#   17:46:27.818412 "druby://kault.local:65172" \u21d2
#                     ("druby://kault.local:63874", 70093484759080).renew()
#   17:46:27.818709 "druby://kault.local:65172" \u21d0
#                     "druby://kault.local:63874" success: 180
#
# The first two lines are the message-send.  The first field is the timestamp
# of the packet.  The second is the DRb peer the messages was sent from.
# The greater-than sign indicates this is a message-send.  The remainder is
# the DRb peer and object reference (7009...) the message is being sent to
# along with the message (+renew+).  If any arguments were present they would
# appear in the argument list.
#
# The URIs are quoted to make it easy to copy part of the message into irb if
# you want to perform further debugging.  For example, you can attach to the
# peer sending the message with:
#
#   >> sender = DRb::DRbObject.new_with_uri "druby://kault.local:65172"
#
# You can re-send the message by copying the message from the first
# open parenthesis to the end of the line:
#
#   >> DRb::DRbObject.new_with("druby://kault.local:63874", 70093484759080).
#        renew()
#
# For the second two lines are the return value from the message-send.  Here
# they are again:
#
#   17:46:27.818709 "druby://kault.local:65172" \u21d0
#                     "druby://kault.local:63874" success: 180
#
# The fields are the timestamp, the DRb peer that sent the message and is
# receiving the result, the DRb peer that received the message, "success" for
# a non-exception result and the response value.
#
# Unlike +tcpdump+ drbdump always shows the peer that send the message on the
# left and uses the arrow to indicate the direction of the message.
#
# Note that the message-send and its result may be separated by other messages
# and results, so you will need to check the port values to connect a message
# send to its result.
#
# == Statistics
#
# To run drbdump in a to only display statistical information, run:
#
#   drbdump -n -q -c 10000
#
# This disables name resolution and per-message output, collects 10,000
# messages then prints statistics at exit.  Depending on the diversity of
# messages in your application you may need to capture a different amount of
# packets.
#
# On supporting operating systems (OS X, BSD) you can send a SIGINFO
# (control-t) to display current statistics for the basic counters at any
# time:
#
#   load: 0.91  cmd: ruby 31579 running 2.48u 8.64s
#   29664 total packets captured
#   71 Rinda packets received
#   892 DRb packets received
#   446 messages sent
#   446 results received
#   0 exceptions raised
#
# These statistics are also printed when you quit drbdump.
#
# At exit, per-message statistics are displayed including message name, the
# number of argument count (to help distinguish between messages with the same
# name and different receivers), a statistical summary of allocations required
# to load the message's objects and a statistical summary of total latency
# (from first packet of the message-send to last packet of the message result:
#
#   Messages sent min, avg, max, stddev:
#   call         (1 args) 12 sent; 3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 0.0 allocations;

#   add          (1 args)  2 sent; 3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 0.0 allocations;

#   update       (1 args)  2 sent; 3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 0.0 allocations;
#                                  0.246, 0.272, 0.298, 0.037 ms

#
# (The above has been line-wrapped, display output is one line per.)
#
# This helps you determine which message-sends are causing more network
# traffic or are less performant overall.  Some message-sends may be naturally
# long running so a high result latency may not be indicative of a
# poorly-performing method.
#
# Messages with higher numbers of allocations typically take longer to send
# and load and create more pressure on the garbage collector.  You can change
# locations that call these messages to use DRb::DRbObject references to help
# reduce the size of the messages sent.
#
# Switching entirely to sending references may increase latency as the remote
# end needs to continually ask the sender to invoke methods on its behalf.
#
# A summary of results is also shown:
#
#   Results received min, avg, max, stddev:
#   success:   24 received; 0.0, 0.6, 2.0, 0.9 allocations
#   exception:  2 received; 16.0, 16.0, 16.0, 0.0 allocations
#
# To help determine if changes you make are causing too many messages drbdump
# shows the number of messages sent between peers along with the message
# latency:
#
#   Peers min, avg, max, stddev:
#   6 messages from "druby://a.example:54167" to "druby://a.example:54157"

#
# (The above has been line-wrapped, display output is one line per.)
#
# To save terminal lines (the peers report can be long when many messages are
# captured) any single-peer results are wrapped up into a single line
# aggregate.

# An efficient API between peers would send the fewest messages with the

#
# == Replaying packet logs
#
# You can capture and record packets with tcpdump then replay the captured
# file with drbdump.  To record captured packets use <code>tcpdump -w
# dump_file</code>:
#
#   $ tcpdump -i lo0 -w drb.pcap [filter]
#
# To replay the capture with drbdump give the path to the dump file to
# <code>drbdump -i</code>:
#
#   $ drbdump -i drb.pcap
